# CellCompeteChallenge

The challenge was to write a program that would determine changes between cells over any number of days.

The rules are if the adjacent cells are either booth off or both on the cell becomes dormant (represented by 0).  
Only if the adjacent cells are one off and one on does the cell become active (represented by a 1)
